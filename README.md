# Collatz-Trajectories
The purpose of this algorithm is to asses certain collat trajectories seen in the Paper Burson, Roy. "Integer Representations and Trajectories of the 3x+ 1 Problem." arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.10566 (2019).

The file "Linear_collatz_function.py" creates 2 excel files titles "data.csv" and "average_value_data.csv" that can be used to graph the emperical results. You can graph the results with any graphing utilities including excel. However, it is recomned to have MATLAB installed on your device and run the program "trajectories_algo.M". The use can specify any linear trajectory. To replicate the results in the paper one must choose your first input to be less than 100000 and then your coeefiecent to be 3 and intercept to be 2. 

Instructions:
1) Download Zipped Folder
2) compile python programm "Linear_collatz_function.py"
3) open Matlab file "trajectories_algo.M" and compile the program.
4) If your graphs didnt appear your did something wrong.
